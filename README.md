##  Scenario: Improving a Mobile App Based on Customer Feedback

You're a product manager tasked with analyzing user feedback to identify pain points and suggest improvements for your mobile app. You want to use prompt engineering to guide an AI assistant in generating insights and recommendations.

---

### Straightforward Prompts

**Technique**: Direct and clear instructions without added structure.

**Prompt Example**:
> "Analyze this customer feedback and suggest three improvements for our mobile app."

**Response Outcome**:
- Identifies recurring issues (e.g., app crashes, slow loading).
- Suggests actionable fixes (e.g., optimize performance, improve UI).

**Use Case**: Quick insights when time is limited or when the task is simple.

---

###  Tabular Format Prompting

**Technique**: Request structured output in table format for clarity and comparison.

**Prompt Example**:
> "Create a table listing common user complaints, their frequency, and suggested fixes based on this feedback."

**Response Outcome**:

| Complaint             | Frequency | Suggested Fix               |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| App crashes often    | High      | Improve backend stability   |
| Slow loading times   | Medium    | Optimize image compression  |
| Confusing interface  | Medium    | Redesign navigation layout  |

**Use Case**: Ideal for presentations, reports, or when comparing multiple factors.

---

###  Missing Word Prompting

**Technique**: Leave blanks in the prompt to encourage the AI to infer or complete information.

**Prompt Example**:
> "Users are frustrated because the app ______ during peak hours. To fix this, we should ______."

**Response Outcome**:
> "Users are frustrated because the app crashes during peak hours. To fix this, we should scale server capacity."

**Use Case**: Useful for brainstorming, creative writing, or testing AI inference.

---

###  Preceding Question Prompting

**Technique**: Ask a guiding question before the main prompt to provide context or focus.

**Prompt Example**:
> "What are the most common issues users face with mobile apps? Now, based on this feedback, suggest improvements for our app."

**Response Outcome**:
- Lists typical issues (e.g., battery drain, poor UX).
- Applies those insights to the specific feedback provided.

**Use Case**: Great for layered reasoning or when the task benefits from contextual grounding.
